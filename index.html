    <h1>POC: User recording with silence removal</h1>
    <p><small>Enrique Aparicio Castellanos</small></p>
    <p><strong>Readme:</strong></p>
    <p>If this is the first time you run the programme (by pressing the Record button), a pop-up will appear asking you to allow the use of the microphone in this browser. Once accepted, you will be able to test the system as many times as necessary.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
    <p>Once you press the Record button, the system starts recording avoiding silences. There is a threshold that defines whether it is silence or not, so if you speak too softly into the microphone, the system can detect it as silence.</p>
    <p>To stop the recording and generate the audio file, simply press the Stop button.</p>
